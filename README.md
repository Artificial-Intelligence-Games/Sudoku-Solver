## Introduction

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This project offers a comprehensive Sudoku solver that employs multiple algorithms to tackle Sudoku puzzles of varying complexities. Whether you enjoy traditional algorithmic approaches or more heuristic-based strategies, this solver has you covered.

## Features

- Solve Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels.
- Multiple solving algorithms to choose from, including Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, BFS Iterative, and A* Search.
- Interactive command-line interface for ease of use.
- Visual representation of puzzle solving progress.
